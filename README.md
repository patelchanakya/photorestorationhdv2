## Migration from auth schema

According to this - https://github.com/Razikus/supabase-nextjs-template/issues/4

We are no longer able to modify auth schema. I modified original migrations to rename it to custom schema. If you need to migrate from older version - check supabase/migrations_for_old/20250525183944_auth_removal.sql

## SupaNuggets

## 📦 Getting Started - local dev

1. Fork or clone repository
2. Prepare Supabase Project URL (Project URL from `Project Settings` -> `API` -> `Project URL`)
3. Prepare Supabase Anon and Service Key (`Anon Key`, `Service Key` from `Project Settings` -> `API` -> `anon public` and `service_role`)
4. Prepare Supabase Database Password  (You can reset it inside `Project Settings` -> `Database` -> `Database Password`)
5. If you already know your app url -> adjust supabase/config.toml `site_url` and `additional_redirect_urls`, you can do it later
6. Run following commands (inside root of forked / downloaded repository):

```bash
# Login to supabase
npx supabase login
# Link project to supabase (require database password) - you will get selector prompt
npx supabase link

# Send config to the server - may require confirmation (y)
npx supabase config push

# Up migrations
npx supabase migrations up --linked

```

7. Go to next/js folder and run `yarn`
8. Copy .env.template to .env.local
9. Adjust .env.local
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://APIURL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=ANONKEY
PRIVATE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=SERVICEROLEKEY

```
10. Run yarn dev
11. Go to http://localhost:3000 🎉

## 🚀 Getting Started - deploy to vercel

1. Fork or clone repository
2. Create project in Vercel - choose your repo
3. Paste content of .env.local into environment variables
4. Click deploy
5. Adjust in supabase/config.toml site_url and additional_redirect_urls (important in additional_redirect_urls is to have https://YOURURL/** - these 2 **)

eady to code?                                             │

│ Here is Claude's plan:                                     │
│ ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │
│ │ Plan to Fix "HD Image Restoration" Display Names       │ │
│ │                                                        │ │
│ │ Issue Analysis                                         │ │
│ │                                                        │ │
│ │ - All images show "HD Image Restoration" because this  │ │
│ │ hardcoded value is stored in the prompt field of       │ │
│ │ saved_images table                                     │ │
│ │ - No automated system exists to transfer completed     │ │
│ │ processing jobs to saved_images                        │ │
│ │ - The UI displays image.prompt as the image title      │ │
│ │                                                        │ │
│ │ Proposed Solution                                      │ │
│ │                                                        │ │
│ │ 1. Create automated job-to-image conversion system:    │ │
│ │   - Add logic to automatically create saved_images     │ │
│ │ records when processing jobs complete                  │ │
│ │   - Generate meaningful prompts/titles based on        │ │
│ │ original filename or user input                        │ │
│ │   - Handle the transfer in the Edge Function webhook   │ │
│ │ when jobs complete successfully                        │ │
│ │ 2. Improve prompt generation:                          │ │
│ │   - Use original filename (cleaned up) as the default  │ │
│ │ prompt                                                 │ │
│ │   - Allow users to optionally specify custom titles    │ │
│ │ during upload                                          │ │
│ │   - Remove timestamp suffixes for cleaner display      │ │
│ │ names                                                  │ │
│ │ 3. Database cleanup:                                   │ │
│ │   - Update existing records with better prompt values  │ │
│ │ derived from their original URLs                       │ │
│ │   - Ensure all future records have meaningful prompts  │ │
│ │                                                        │ │
│ │ Implementation Steps                                   │ │
│ │                                                        │ │
│ │ 1. Update Edge Function to create saved_images records │ │
│ │  on job completion                                     │ │
│ │ 2. Add logic to generate clean, meaningful prompts     │ │
│ │ from filenames                                         │ │
│ │ 3. Update existing database records with better        │ │
│ │ prompts                                                │ │
│ │ 4. Test the full flow from upload to history display   │ │
│ │                                                        │ │
│ │ This will ensure users see meaningful, recognizable    │ │
│ │ names for their restored photos instead of the generic │ │
│ │  "HD Image Restoration" text.
